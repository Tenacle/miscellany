# Description
Compilation of programs I've made while I was studying at Uni. I will fork out specific programs that I take interest in and develop it further whenever I have the motivation to. Most programs are in-progress and unfinished.

In progress. Will be adding more. I'm cleaning them up before adding them here.

## Cryptography
* [Shift and Vigenere cipher](./cryptography/shift%20and%20vigenere%20cipher). Encrypts a msg using either ciphers.
* [AES implementation](./cryptography/AES). Forked from my COMP 4140 A1. Encrypts a msg using AES. Fixed sbox. Unchecked, 100% unreliable. I think I broke something here.
* [DES attack](./cryptography/DES%20atk). Forked from my COMP 4140 A3. Attacked DES sbox. Unfinished.

## Network
* [peer-to-peer](./network/P2P). Forked from my COMP 3010 A3. Multiple instances needed so they would be able to interact with each other. Simulates joining/leaving and file transfers.
* [reverse path forwarding](./network/RPF%20-%20reverse%20path%20forwarding). Forked from my COMP 4300 A3. Simulates RPF on a network and outputs statistics. 
* [point-to-point](./network/aloha%20-%20point-to-point). Forked from my COMP 4300 A1. Simulates aloha network. Unfinished.
* [cgi](./network/cgi). Some cgi files I made from class.

## OS
* [NTFS file reader](./OS/NTFS%20file%20reader). Forked from my COMP 3430 A4. I plan on being able to fully read any NTFS drive (maybe have it work in a macOS.)
* [pi using threads](./OS/pi%20using%20threads). Forked from my COMP 3430 A1. Simple, for understanding threads. Uses threads to compute pi with *k* size. Found linear growth, apparent growth with more threads.
* [interprocess comms](./OS/interprocess%20comms). Forked form my COMP 3430 A2. Simple, for understanding inter-process communication and signaling.
* [Schedulers](./OS/scheduling). Forked from my COMP3430 A3. RR, STCP, priority. For statistics.

## String manipulation
* [BattleText breaker](./string%20manipulation/BattleText_breaker). Gives me a dictionary of words based on constraints shown in an mobile game app BattleText. Similar to scrabble.
* [Keyword highlighter](./string%20manipulation/keyword_parser). Parses paragraphs and seperates them into sentences and highlights keywords present. I used this in my Philosophy classes to find premises and conclusions in possible arguments.
* [sbeve](./string%20manipulation/sbeve). Meme "She BElieVEd" generator.
