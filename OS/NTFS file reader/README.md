# Program information
Below are general information regarding the code I have written.
## Compiling
`make`
- Compiles the program which outputs programs: `q1` for question 1.
- `make -e "FLAGS = -DDEBUG"` compiles the program in debug mode which provides extra information when run. *Not really needed*.
- Makefile made from previous assignment's Makefile (*the ones provided from assignments*)
## Exectution
`./q1 <file> <cmd>`
- This is to run question 1's code. More about it [here](#Question-1)
- Commands:
 - info		
 - list		
 - get		

# Levels
## Level 2
`info` command is implemented and works correctly
- `list` was broken and I did not have time to fix it.
