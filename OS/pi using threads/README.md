# description
I am assigned to *compute pi* using *threads* and *processes*. I have made the computations as per requirement found on the materials provided.
- The program compiles properly.
- Computations are INF but are followed by carefully as provided in the materials.
## hardwork
- computation for summations.
- *k* for summation is incremented here.
## stop_worker
- made some variation to return value for the rest of the computation
## main
- finalizes computation found from other *workers*.
- I find it hard to get a library that is good enough to show the values of pi. I opt to not include them since timings and performance are more important
# Findings
- threads are faster overall. 
- linear growth is experienced.
- as more *workers* are added, the growth becomes more apparent.
