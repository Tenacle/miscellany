When we consider either the history of opinion, or the ordinary conduct of human life, to what is it to be ascribed that the one and the other are no worse than they are? Not certainly to the inherent force of the human understanding; for, on any matter not self-evident, there are ninetynine persons totally incapable of judging of it for one who is capable; and the capacity of the hundredth person is only comparative; for the majority of the eminent men of every past generation held many opinions now known to be erroneous, and did or approved numerous things which no one will now justify. Why is it, then, that there is on the whole a preponderance among mankind of rational opinions and rational conduct? If there really is this preponderance— which there must be unless human affairs are, and have always been, in an almost desperate state—it is owing to a quality of the human mind, the source of everything respectable in man either as an intellectual or as a moral being, namely, that his errors are corrigible. He is capable of rectifying his mistakes, by discussion and experience. Not by experience alone. There must be discussion, to show how experience is to be interpreted. Wrong opinions and practices gradually yield to fact and argument; but facts and arguments, to produce any effect on the mind, must be brought before it. Very few facts are able to tell their own story, without comments to bring out their meaning. The whole strength and value, then, of human judgment, depending on the one property, that it can be set right when it is wrong, reliance can be placed on it only when the means of setting it right are kept constantly at hand. In the case of any person whose judgment is really deserving of confidence, how has it become so? Because he has kept his mind open to criticism of his opinions and conduct. Because it has been his practice to listen to all that could be said against him; to profit by as much of it as was just, and expound to himself, and upon occasion to others, the fallacy of what was fallacious. Because he has felt, that the only way in which a human being can make some approach to knowing the whole of a subject, is by hearing what can be said about it by persons of every variety of opinion, and studying all modes in which it can be looked at by every character of mind. No wise man ever acquired his wisdom in any mode but this; nor is it in the nature of human intellect to become wise in any other manner. The steady habit of correcting and completing his own opinion by collating it with those of others, so far from causing doubt and hesitation in carrying it into practice, is the only stable foundation for a just reliance on it: for, being cognisant of all that can, at least obviously, be said against him, and having taken up his position against all gainsayers—knowing that he has sought for objections and difficulties, instead of avoiding them, and has shut out no light which can be thrown upon the subject from any quarter—he has a right to think his judgment better than that of any person, or any multitude, who have not gone through a similar process.

# Q1:
Why not be a ‘cheap hawk,’ letting others take care of the world’s business? The answer is easy. The Japanese won’t take care of free trade…. The Russians, if left alone, will happily sell nuclear-weapons technology to Iran, and the French would be similarly obliging about lifting the embargo on Iraq. And who will contain China, the next superpower?
# Q2:
Our experience constantly confirms the principle of cause and effect. Thus, whatever begins to exist has a cause. And since according to the renowned physicist Stephen Hawking, “Almost everyone now believes that the universe, and time itself, had a beginning at the Big Bang,” it follows that the universe began to exist. Therefore, the universe was caused by God.
# Q3:
Determinism seems to conflict with the thesis that we have moral responsibilities, for responsibility implies that we could have done otherwise than we did. We do not hold a dog morally responsible for chewing up our philosophy book or hold a one-month-old baby responsible for crying, because they could not help it, but we do hold a twenty-year-old student responsible for his cheating because (we believe) he could have done otherwise. That determinism is incompatible with moral responsibility and must be rejected can be defended in the following argument. Since in order to have a moral duty to do Act A we must be able to do A and able to refrain from doing A, it follows that being morally responsible for doing A entails that I could have done otherwise if I had chosen to do so. Determinism holds that our actions are merely the product of the laws of nature and antecedent states of affairs. So, determinism entails that we do not make choices. Thus, if determinism is true we are not morally responsible for what we do. But our moral responsibility for our actions is self-evidently true. Therefore, determinism with respect to human action must be rejected.
