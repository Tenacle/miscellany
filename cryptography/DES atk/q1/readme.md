# Question 1
todo. needs more stuff.
All I have here are stripped down functions from previous question. Not much to see :(
## Description
DES atk Implementation
## Running
Run with: `q1 <sbox> <key> <msg>`

e.g. `q1 t1_msg.txt t1_key.txt sbox1.txt sbox1.txt`

Valid files with proper formatting is required (format provided by prof.)

## Output
The program will output current status in **stderr**. It will print (most) major state changes and computations made.

## CURRENT STATUS PLEASE READ
* Implemented all stages properly except inverse of mixColumns
* Running the code 

## Notes
* Developed in the aviary machines
* Used the Makefile provided by the prof.
* Have some seperate headers and source files to make things a bit clean (and reusable).
* If there are any, links are provided to code snippets which I've heavily relied on.
